This is my first post, woohoo! I’m not expecting anyone to read my posts, but in case there is a friendly reader occasionally, I thought I would introduce myself briefly. My name is Jun, and I wanted a medium to contain my thoughts and progress while I venture through life and learn more about myself. The main journey that I would like to document is my path to achieving my dream — becoming a software engineer. Maybe I’ll have a few occasional posts on my other interests (clothing, music, and cryptocurrency to name a few), but for now, I wish to share my story with my future self and with you guys as well. My writing will be informal and conversational, as that is how I most comfortably interact, so please ignore any grammatical errors or awkward jargon that I may have!

So, why a software engineer? Well, the short-term goal is to become a software developer, although both titles are used interchangeably. I’ll just keep it simple and say software engineer, although I know that there are a lot of arguments about engineering vs development, but to me the title is not too important. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Biochemical Engineering from the University of Southern California. I learned about biotechnology and took all those pre-med classes that everyone hates (Molecular Biology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, etc.). Why did I choose to go through that hardship, only to discover that I wanted to do something related to web development? Why did I “suddenly develop” a passion for software engineering?

Well, many people around me may think that my passion “suddenly developed”, but for me, it started off at a younger age, around freshman year in high school. My high school didn’t offer any computer science related classes, or any programming classes, but I was interested and decided to follow a C++ tutorial on YouTube. I was quickly discouraged because the tutorial I was following was probably not suited for a beginner programmer, but rather for an intermediate or even an advanced programmer. I struggled with understanding concepts like memory management, and eventually gave up and was afraid to work on anything programming related. When the time came to decide what I wanted to study in college, I decided to choose something that I felt was predetermined for me — a career related to biological sciences. My dad is a professor doing cancer research, so from one reason to another, everyone around me expected to follow a similar path. Foolishly, I thought that as well. I mean, biology seemed intuitive to me (at least in the shallow depths), and I was good at it, so why not? I chose to study Biology at USC under the pre-med track, where I aimed to become a doctor after medical school.

During my first semester at USC, I realized how much technology was growing and the influences technology had around the world. I wanted to do something more technological, and decided that medical school wasn’t really what I wanted to do after graduating college. I wanted to find work after graduating, and become involved and contribute to technological advances within the medical field. I changed my major to Biomedical Engineering, because it was a “safe” option, where I combine my biological knowledge with my love for technology. I had so many colleagues and friends studying computer science, so I was afraid I would be behind if I changed to CS. Now me would have had no problem changing to CS, but past me was scared to fall behind and not do well. Anyways, throughout my BME degree, I learned Matlab, Labview, and a little bit of R and C++ and realized that I wasn’t so bad at programming. I was still discouraged from my high school trauma of C++, but I realized that I gave up too early and probably should’ve looked at other resources if I really wanted to learn. I even passed the certification test to become an Associate Labview Developer, even though a big part of it was due to my professor teaching us Labview excellently! I wanted to learn more and more about development and programming, and thus started my new academic life of self-studying programming.

I started by learning Python, going through Python Crash Course and Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. I enjoyed the little projects that the lessons had and creating the simplest programs. I was having fun! I wanted to create something more comprehensive and involved, so I started to learn Django by following a Udemy course. I enjoyed learning Django, but after doing more research, I found Javascript to be more widely used by companies, so I decided to learn Javascript! Since then, I have been learning Javascript through freeCodeCamp, Javascript30, Udemy courses, reading documentation on MDN, watching YouTube videos, basically anything that’s available on the web! I have been having so much fun learning how to develop web applications, that I have developed a strong passion in becoming a software engineer. I know I may be at a disadvantage because I lack a computer science degree, but if anything, my engineering degree has really taught me how to learn. I know with time and effort, I can prove myself to be a skilled developer worth hiring. I’m still early in my journey, but please join me as I share my experiences and path to becoming a software engineer!
